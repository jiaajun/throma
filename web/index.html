            The Avian Welfare Coalition’s National Bird Day campaign aims to reduce the suffering of birds by raising public awareness of the destructive bird trade, the realities of cruel bird breeding mills, and ways to improve the welfare of birds already in captivity. <br><br>

        <h1>What Else Can We Do To Help?</h1>
        <div class="educate-text">1) Educate your family about endangered species in your area. It’s not just about snow leopards in Russia, it’s about the ecosystem in your own backyard. Teach your friends and family about wildlife, birds, fish and plants that live near you. Just awareness of these species is a critical step. From the worms in the garden to the bats that pollinate and control the mosquitos, there are many ways that our daily habits at home affect these creatures.</div>
        <div class="educate-text">2) Reduce your personal footprint. Drive less, walk more.  Support better public transport, use biodegradable products and eat whole food from your farmers market.</div>
        <div class="educate-text">3) Do not purchase products from companies that are known polluters. Many industries pollute natural water resources and lobby hard so that they don’t have to clean up their own messes. You can do your part by not giving these companies your business, and cast your vote with your dollar.  Spread the word about bad business practices and when it dings their bottom lines, these companies will take notice.</div>
        <div class="educate-text">4) Pledge to not buy any illegal wildlife products or endengered species parts. <br><br> This includes: <br> 
            <ul>
                <li>Not buying souvenirs made from endangered animal parts.</li>
                <li>Not eating any wild meat.</li>
                <li>Checking the ingredients list of traditional medicines before you buy.</li>
                <li>Not keeping any wild animals as pets</li>
                <li>Not buying wild animals with the intention to rescue them. This only creates more demand which incentives the hunting of wild animals.</li>
                <li>Ask questions before you buy any goods. Make sure that the goods are legally sourced.</li>
            </ul> <br> <br>
